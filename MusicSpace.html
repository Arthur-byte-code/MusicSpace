            <p><p>Yes!<br>
              Let us start this quest<br>
              Let me say first of all that I feel blessed<br>
              Just waking up every day is a prize<br>
              Feeling all the love before I open my eyes<br>
              It wasn't always like this<br>
              Strife is...<br>
              A conduit to make us feel lifeless..<br></p>
              <p>So lost in the adds, fads, drags us down<br>
              To a lower level where we can't be found<br>
              But in this underground we forge our own paths<br>
              The sun still shines<br>
              And yes we do laugh<br>
              Yes we do have the things you wanna sell us<br>
              Fulfilled from within despite what you tell us<br>
              Rebellious is the spirit that flies..<br>
              So ethereal that earth becomes skies...<br></p>
              <p>I've gotta say with no further ado<br>
              We're happy to be here with you<br></p>
              Chorus (Ayla):
              
              <p>So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>
              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶<br>
              So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>
              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶<br>
              So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>
              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶</p>
              Verse 2 (Mr. Lif):
              
              <p>It's just another harsh case of cannibalism<br>
              Oops, I really meant to say capitalism...<br></p>
              <p>After the rhythm dies down...<br>
              Will it revitalize your soul when you remember the sound?<br></p>
              <p>If not, you're listening to audio garbage<br>
              Shitty as can be<br>
              R.I.P.<br>
              No homage<br></p>
              <p>We hit the lab, and we're hoping to accomplish<br>
              Jams that'll lead you to the land that's promised<br></p>
              <p>Honest<br>
              Raw sentiments project<br>
              You see us at the set<br>
              And we instantly connect<br></p>
              <p>Cause we've been thinking bout y'all for days<br>
              So here's a little something for us modern day slaves...<br></p>
              <p>No companies, no filters, no residue<br>
              Just the impact of this vibe we're sending you<br></p>
              <p>I've gotta say with no further ado<br>
              We're happy to be here with you<br></p>
              Chorus (Ayla):
              
              <p>So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>
              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶<br>
              So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>
              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶<br>

              When waves crash shorelines to this heart, and beat by beat taken apart‚Ä¶</p>
              Verse 3 (Mr. Lif):
              
              <p>"Why"<br>
              A usual way we start questions<br>
              "How" we advance through life & learn lessons<br>
              Suggestions are made and then explored<br>
              I'm positive<br>
              Whatever's negative gets ignored<br></p>
              <p>We're on a mission<br>
              Can you see that?<br>
              I float a theory through the air, now can you breathe that?<br></p>
              <p>If you inhale<br>
              Then you embark on a tale<br>
              Don't grieve over things you leave<br>
              Just set sail<br></p>
              <p>There's no fail<br>
              There is only success<br>
              If you learn from mistakes you made, and progress<br></p>
              <p>Maybe it's best that we halt this discussion<br>
              Sit back and just bathe in percussion<br></p>
              <p>Let the rhythm just carry us away<br>
              As we twirl through the atmosphere<br>
              And just sway<br></p>
              <p>I've gotta say with no further ado<br>
              We're happy to be here with you<br></p>
              Chorus (Ayla):
              
              <p>So you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become soul<br>

                  <p>(I got a hole where my heart used to be)</p>
              
                  <p>I'm a real true artist, put all of my heart in this<br>
                  I live for the basslines and guitar riffs<br>
                  But too modest, the music biz<br>
                  Is a vast sea, and you know where the sharks is</p>
              
                  <p>I discovered hip-hop as a little tyke<br>
                  Before I kissed a girl or ever rid a bike<br>
                  There was nothin' about it the kid didn't like, so an<br>
                  Obsession was born for written rhymes ripping mics</p>
              
                  <p>My astute pursuit wasn't about loot<br>
                  To boot I studied the game from root to fruit<br>
                  People gathered in flocks, hip-hop, had the<br>
                  Block locked and had us thinking out of the box</p>
              
                  <p>The time we were living in it was a testament<br>
                  For before the corporation would invest in it<br>
                  And now they acting brand new, I'm waving a flag<br>
                  For the culture, they lookin' at me like I'm a damn fool</p>
              
                  <p>(When I was up<br>
                  You would always come around)<br>
                  Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop<br>
                  You are my life</p>
              
                  <p>(But when I needed a friend<br>
                  Oh you can never be found)<br>
                  Hip-hop, hip-hop, you are my friend</p>

                  Hieroglyphics</p>
              
                  <p>What's really relevant, is it good in the<br>
                  Hood if it ain't selling and what is you telling me<br>
                  Back when we was back spinning the party was<br>
                  Packed and it wasn't nobody to stack digits</p>
              
                  <p>They did it for the kids on the block, instead of banging<br>
                  They was hanging out doing that up rock flow rock<br>
                  Hip-hop was there when nobody else cared<br>
                  No education, no healthcare, or welfare</p>
              
                  <p>The Bronx burning we turning into an inferno<br>
                  What do we learn to know when we ain't earning dough<br>
                  We got greedier when the media showed up<br>
                  And got needier when the city disowned us</p>
              
                  <p>I guess it was tryna find a way out the projects<br>
                  And that gentrification is the process to progress<br>
                  God bless the child with the heavenly trust fund<br>
                  The heaviest lump sum that come from the slums</p>
              
                  <p>(When I was up<br>
                  You would always come around)<br>
                  Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop<br>
                  You are my life</p>
