### About the Project

This website is a concept dedicated to providing a space where indie musicians can publicize their own music. Independent artists often face challenges in gaining visibility, and the idea behind this platform is to offer an environment where they can share their creations directly with a broader audience.

However, this project is purely conceptual and does not implement all the functionalities that a complete service would have. It was developed as part of an academic assignment, showcasing the principles of web design and development focused on independent artists. Even though itâ€™s still in the early stages, the site illustrates how it would be possible to create a platform supporting musical diversity, allowing musicians to create profiles, upload tracks, and engage with fans and other artists in a collaborative and user-friendly space.
